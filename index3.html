            <h2>Youtubability</h2>
            <p> A key driver of youtubability is the clarity
                of your gameplay to a potential player. </p>
            <p> Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the
                full potential of your game by working on
                getting the lowest possible CPIs for your
                games.</p>
            <p> Many elements can be used to make your
                game clearer :</p>
            <p> For instance, ask yourself if a user’s interaction
                with the game is evident, for
                example, can she tell which character she
                controls? Is the objective clear? Does it
                look fun to play? Has she understood the
                game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
                seconds (too long!).</p>
            <p> Make sure to use colours to help indicate
                the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
                Jump, obstacles are clearly contrasted (in
                orange here) and instantly recognized as
                a threat.

            <p>If you want to run user tests with
                friends and family or even random
                people in the street, it is interesting to
                show them the 30 second video before
                making them try to prototype in order
                to understand their expectations from
                the video vs. the actual game they try.</p>
            <p> Make it obvious with visual elements
                that help understand the objective and
                controls of the game, like with the
                target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s
                Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw
                Car with the space dedicated to
                drawing

            <p>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games on their
                phone’s Facebook feed, everything will seem smaller than when
                displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. You should
                also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if
                someone watches it on a small screen. With an average watch time of 3
                to 5 seconds, this is an accelerated elevator pitch!</p>
            <p>Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on
                YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea
                for your game videos.
